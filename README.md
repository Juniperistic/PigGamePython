I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/21FnnGKSRZo?si=MuGbBqBKqRWSMMJy).
I created the pig game which is a muiltiplayer game. It is 2-4 players.
In each turn the player can roll the die as many times as they'd like. 
The die allows you to roll a number 1-6. If you roll a 1 then your turn is 
over and your score for the turn resets to 0. If you roll a 2-6 then it gets
added to your score for the turn. Once your turn is over as long as you have
not rolled a 1 your score for the turn is added to your total score. The first 
player to reach the max score (currently set to 50) is the winner.
